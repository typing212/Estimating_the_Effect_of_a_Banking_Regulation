Causal Inference

## Key Words
Difference in Differences

## Content
In order to analyze the implications the Volcker Rule has on banksâ€™ relevant business models, DiD (Difference in Differences) is used to specifically analyze changes in bank trading asset ratio, which is treated as the main business indicator. In this paper, the regulation is assumed to be the only strong endogenous shock. Also, based on experience, the previous differences between treatment banks and control banks are stable. Therefore, DiD is used in this paper to solve this problem.

## Dataset
Our dataset is constructed on the bank holding companies (BHCs) level provided by the professor. The selected dataset contains one timestamp column, the full set of BHCs (652 individual institutions after cleaning) and selected financial data, such as return on assets. Dataset across quarters from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2015, 40 timestamps in total. 

## Insights
According to the research, banks with a high proportion of trading assets start to comply with the new law by reducing trading assets. Because the law was not fully implemented until late 2017, affected banks sustained their trading assets ratio to 8% in order to maintain profitability and control risks.

When implementing DFA or similar policies to strip banks of non-banking businesses, banks can predict the degree of impact according to our research results and respond by adjusting liabilities, operating costs and deposit reserve ratio, etc. At the same time, the government can assess the impact of relevant policies on the banking sector and warn high-risk enterprises in advance. Moreover, features that we identified above as important identifiers (return on assets, loan ratio, leverage ratio and propensity score) can be reviewed by both banks and the government as red flags of high risks in terms of policy.
